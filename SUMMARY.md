# Summary

[Introduction](README.md)

[Bayesian Network Development](chapter1.md)

[BN Workflows with R and RNetica](workflows.md)
This chapter describes any work-flows / best-practice procedures for saving / accessing / organising your work, as you iteratively develop your BN. This chapter addresses two key components of your work-flow:
* Documentation
* Network Development

Documentation is a very important aspect of developing your BN that is essential to ensuring reproducibility. Good documentation is also vital when working in teams, and also just for your own self -- thank me later.

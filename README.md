# R and Netica for Bayesian Networks

This book is a guide to using the Netica API via the R programming language for developing Bayesian Networks. It covers all phases of BN development: from structural development and parameterisation to model evaluation.

To do:

- Explain how to use the license using Rmarkdown docs (R can't find the license key as it does on auto-start-up). This is okay for the workshop / tutorial as we will only be working with small nets so don't need the license. But for people to then go away and use what they've learnt, they'll need to be able to workt with their nets in Rmarkdown. @workflows
